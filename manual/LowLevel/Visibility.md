# Visibility

In the scope of this document, by linker symbols (or symbolf or short) we mean
the names of function and global variable declarations.

The *linkage* of a symbol determines whether or not a symbol is visible outside
the translation unit it is defined in during linking. In other words: the symbol
is available to be linked against from outside the translation unit that it is
defined in.

The *visibility* of a symbol determines whether or not a symbol is visible
outside of the shared object that it is defined in during linking. In other
words: the symbol is available to be linked against from outside the shared
object that it is defined in.

`hs-bindgen` takes linkage and visibility into account when generating bindings
for global variables and functions. Linker errors are likely for some
combinations of linkage and visibility and so we trace a warning message in
those cases. Such problematic cases of visibility are likely a bug in the C
library and thus should be fixed in the C library.

## Types of linkage

There are [3 types of linkage][linkage]: **external**,
**internal**, or **none**.

* **External**: the symbol is visible outside the translation unit it's defined in.

* **Internal**: the symbol is *not* visible outside the translation unit it's
  defined in.

* **None**: only applies to local objects, such as local variables and function
  parameters.

Since we only generate bindings for top-level declarations, we will only
consider **external** and **internal** linkage from now on.

**External** and **internal** linkage can be implemented using the `extern` and
`static` keywords respectively, but there are other factors that determine the
linkage of declarations.

## Types of visibility

There are [4 types of visibility][visibility]: **default**, **hidden**,
**internal**, and **protected**. We leave out descriptions for **internal** and
**protected** because they are rarely used in practice, and for our purposes of
binding generation we can treat them as **hidden** (they lead to linker errors
in all the same way). We will call **hidden**, **internal** and **protected**:
**non-public** visibility.

* **Default:** The symbol is visible outside the shared object that it is
  defined in. Despite the name, **default** always means public.

* **Hidden:**  The symbol is *not* visible outside the shared object that it is
  defined in.

[Visibility attributes][visibility] in C code affect visibility, but so do [GCC
options][gcc-options] and [Clang options][clang-options]. As such, it is
technically not sufficient to look at the syntax of the C code to determine
visibility. Currently we obtain the visibility of functions and variables (see
the `getCursorVisibility` function) purely syntactically regardless.

TODO: we currently use `clang` for parsing in `hs-bindgen` without an
`-fvisilibity` option. Should we? What if a shared library is compiled and
linked using `-fvisibility=hidden`, but we use clang in `hs-bindgen` with
`-fvisibility=default`? It sounds like that would be wrong.

### Example linker error

NOTE: the example in this section can be readily adapted to global variables
instead of functions. Swap out `foo` for an `extern` variable, and similar
linker errors are observed

Let's say we have a header file `A.h` that declares a function `foo` with hidden
visibility (and external linkage by default):

```c
void __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden"))) foo (void);
```

Let's also assume `A.c` includes a definition for this `foo` function. We can
compile this into a shared library `libA.so` like so:

```
❯ gcc -Wall -o A.o -c -fPIC A.c
❯ gcc -Wall --shared -o libA.so A.o
```

Now we create a separate file `B.c` that uses the `foo` function from
`libA.so`.

```c
#include "A.h"
void bar (void) { foo(); }
```

If we try to compile the following code and link it against `libA.so`, we
would get linker errors.

```
❯ gcc -Wall -o B.o -c -fPIC B.c
❯ gcc -Wall --shared -o libB.so B.o libA.so
/usr/bin/ld: B.o: in function `bar':
B.c:(.text+0x9): undefined reference to `foo'
/usr/bin/ld: libB.so: hidden symbol `foo' isn't defined
/usr/bin/ld: final link failed: bad value
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

Even if a definition for `foo` is included in `A.c`, this definition is not
visible outside outside of the shared object `libA.so`, so `libB.so` can not use
it! Since we included the header `A.h` in `B.c`, `B.c` will roughly look like
this after preprocessing:

```c
void __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden"))) foo (void); // included from A.h
void bar (void) { foo(); }
```

The only way to make this code compile and link is to define `foo` ourselves,
but that seems silly. Similar errors would occur if `foo` had protected or internal
visibility. Hence, we treat declarations with protected or internal visibility
as if it had hidden visibility.

Header files typically declare non-static functions and global variables
*without* providing a definition in the header file. Instead, the definition is
included in a body file. If such a header file declaration has a non-public
visibility attribute, then the Haskell program will not be able to find the
definition in the C library because it is not visible to the linker.

To conclude, it does not make much sense at all to put non-public functions in
header files, because header files should typically expose the public interface.
Putting a hidden declaration in a header file of a shared library basically
says: "I'm exposing a function name from my library but I'm not letting you use
the definition".

Note that this error only occurs with dynamic libraries. If we were to create a
*static* library out of `A`, then the visibiltity doesn't really lead to errors
when `A` and `B` are linked together, because `A` and `B` are then in the *same
shared object*. Rather, the visibility nows determine which symbols are exposed
from the shared object that includes both `A` and `B`. We currently have not
experiment much with statically linking Haskell bindings with static C libraries
(i.e., archives), but when we do we might have to revisit this manual section.

### Guidelines

Concretely, a linker error can occur for a declared symbol in a header file if
it:

1. has non-public visibility,
2. has external linkage, and
3. is not a definition (and there is no definition elsewhere in the header).

Note that tentative definitions can also act as definitions if there are no full
definitions elsewhere in the header, in which case requirement 3 is satisfied.

Examples:
```c
extern int __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden"))) foo (void);
       int __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden"))) bar (void);
extern int __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden"))) i;
```

Non-examples:
```c
       int __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden"))) foo (void) {return 1;};
static int __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden"))) bar (void) {return 2;};
extern int __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden"))) baz (void) {return 3;};
static int __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden"))) i = 0;
       int __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden"))) j; // tentative definition
```

In cases where the three requirements are met, we emit a warning message, but we
still generate a binding. Arguably declarations like these are a bug in the C
library, given the way that header files are `#include`d in other header and
body files. And note that a linker error would only be thrown if the header file
belongs to a shared library, not a static library.

### Potential duplicates

Duplicate symbols can also exist across multiple shared libraries as long as
these symbols have public visibility. However, in such cases the linker will
pick one according to the rules of linker symbol interposition, rather than
throw a linker error. It can be surprising for users if the linker picks an
unexpected definition for the symbol they are referencing. So, if a symbol has
non-public visibility, the risk of such surprises is mitigated somewhat. This is
also reflected in the warning message that is emitted for potential duplicate
globals.
