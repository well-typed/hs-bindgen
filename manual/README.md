## Handwriting high-level bindings

This section of the manual is not yet written. It should include at least a
chapter with examples on how to write high-level bindings, and chapter on memory
management.

In addition, we will have combinators that will make writing the high-level
bindings easier. This is currently under active development.

This is not yet supported; see the [roadmap](Roadmap.md) for details.
