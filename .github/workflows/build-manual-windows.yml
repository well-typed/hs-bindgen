      # does.

      # Note also that we are not passing '-DSUPPORTS_UNICODE', via
      # BINDGEN_CLANG_ARGS. This option passes SUPPORTS_UNICODE macro to
      # libclang preprocessor. In manual_examples.{c,h} and
      # manual/app/RunManual.hs we have some CPP to replace 拜拜 and ϒ
      # functions by ByeBye and Gamma. This is needed when building with LLVM
      # or (non-LLVM) MacOS. The former because LLVM IR does not support
      # Unicode characters and the latter because Apple's assembler also does
      # not support Unicode characters. In this case we are enabling it
      # because we are building with LLVM backend. This is only needed because
      # when hs-bindgen-cli runs it creates a C-wrapper around functions which
      # need to be compiled, however if it would be something other than a
      # function like 'typedef int 数字;' it would work[^1].
      #
      # [^1]: It would work in all OSs except Windows.

      # Environment variables:
      #
      # * PATH - The PATH is used for locating DLLs, so it is critical that the
      #   LLVM/Clang bin directory is prepended to the system PATH.  Otherwise,
      #   hs-bindgen will dynamically load the libclang.dll for a different
      #   version of LLVM/Clang.  Note that this is a change to the system path,
      #   using Windows path syntax.
      #
      # * LLVM_PATH - This is not used to configure our Haskell clang package
      #   when building because LLVM_CONFIG (configured below) takes precedence.
      #   It is used when determining the builtin include directory, however.
      #   It is not necessary with the above PATH configuration.
      #
      # * LLVM_CONFIG - This is used to configure our Haskell clang package when
      #   building.  It is not necessary with the above PATH configuration.
      #
      # * LIBCLANG_PATH - This is used by the Rust clang-sys package that
      #   rust-bindgen uses.  It is likely not needed in this job because we do
      #   not run the Rust tests.
      #
      # * C_INCLUDE_PATH - This is used to configure the builtin include
      #   directory.  It is temporary and hard-codes the LLVM/Clang version.  It
      #   will no longer be needed once automatic configuration of the builtin
      #   include directory is working.
